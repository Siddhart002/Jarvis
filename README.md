Our project is a cutting-edge Chrome extension that serves as an intelligent interface between users and AI models. It provides a seamless experience for summarizing content, videos, and online shopping. Users can engage in direct chats with the AI, enabling dynamic interactions. The chatbot is built with extensibility in mind, allowing easy integration with various AI models in the future. This project also lays the foundation for advanced features, such as global context management, which can be extended to further personalize and improve the user experience.

Key Features:

Content Summarization: The AI quickly processes and summarizes articles, web pages, and other content, allowing users to gain key insights without sifting through lengthy texts.

Video Summarization: The extension can analyze and summarize videos, delivering concise takeaways for users who need a quick overview without watching the entire video.

Online Shopping Assistance: Users can receive product recommendations, compare prices, and browse shopping sites more effectively, with the chatbot offering helpful insights to streamline the purchasing journey.

Chat Interface: The chatbot offers real-time communication with the AI, enabling users to ask questions, get recommendations, and engage in personalized conversations.

AI Model Integration: The extension is designed to serve as a versatile interface, making it easy to integrate additional AI models to expand functionality, ensuring scalability.

Global Context Management (Future Extension): While not yet implemented, the extension is designed with potential for global context management. This would allow the extension to track user preferences and behaviors over time, adapting to the userâ€™s needs without requiring them to reset preferences each time. This feature would make the chatbot more context-aware, delivering a more personalized and tailored experience with every interaction.
